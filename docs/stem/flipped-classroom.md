# Flipped Classroom

An instructional strategy that reverses the traditional learning environment. Students are first exposed to new material outside of class, usually through pre-recorded video lectures, and then use class time for active learning, such as problem-solving, discussions, and group projects.

## Overview

The Flipped Classroom model moves the passive learning activity (the lecture) out of the classroom, freeing up valuable face-to-face time for more engaging and collaborative activities. The instructor's role shifts from "sage on the stage" to "guide on the side," providing personalized support and deeper learning opportunities during class.

## The Flipped Classroom Structure

### Pre-Class Activities (Outside of Class)
- **Content Delivery:** Students engage with new material through various resources provided by the instructor, such as:
  - Short, focused video lectures (often 5-15 minutes).
  - Readings from textbooks or articles.
  - Interactive simulations or tutorials.
- **Accountability Mechanism:** To ensure students complete the pre-class work, instructors often include a low-stakes assessment, such as:
  - An online quiz.
  - A brief reading response.
  - A prompt asking students to identify the most confusing part of the material (a "muddiest point" submission).

### In-Class Activities (During Class)
- **Active Learning:** Class time is dedicated to activities that require higher-order thinking, such as:
  - **Problem-solving sessions:** Students work in groups on challenging problems, with the instructor available to help.
  - **Labs and experiments:** Hands-on activities that apply the concepts from the pre-class material.
  - **Group discussions and debates:** Students explore complex topics and different perspectives.
  - **Project-based work:** Students collaborate on longer-term projects that require them to apply their knowledge in a creative way.
- **Targeted Instruction:** The instructor can use the data from the pre-class accountability mechanism to identify common areas of confusion and provide targeted mini-lectures or clarifications as needed.

## Benefits in STEM Courses

- **More Efficient Use of Class Time:** Face-to-face time is used for application and synthesis, not just information transmission.
- **Increased Student Engagement:** Active learning is inherently more engaging than passively listening to a lecture.
- **Personalized Learning:** Students can watch pre-class videos at their own pace, and instructors can provide more individualized support during class.
- **Deeper Learning:** By grappling with problems and collaborating with peers, students develop a more robust and lasting understanding of the material.

## Best Practices for a Flipped STEM Classroom

- **Keep Videos Short and Focused:** Aim for micro-lectures that cover a single concept.
- **Make the Connection Clear:** Explicitly connect the pre-class work to the in-class activities.
- **Hold Students Accountable:** Use low-stakes assessments to encourage completion of the pre-class work.
- **Design Meaningful In-Class Activities:** The success of a flipped classroom depends on the quality of the active learning that happens during class time.
