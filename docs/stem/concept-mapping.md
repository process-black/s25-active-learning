# Concept Mapping

A visual tool that helps students organize and represent their knowledge of a subject. Concept maps are graphical representations of concepts and the relationships between them, providing a powerful way to visualize complex information.

## Overview

Concept maps consist of nodes (concepts, usually enclosed in circles or boxes) and links (relationships, represented by lines or arrows). The links are typically labeled with connecting words or phrases to explain the relationship between the concepts. This technique helps students see the big picture and make meaningful connections between different ideas.

## The Concept Mapping Process

### Step 1: Identify the Focus Question (5 minutes)
- The instructor provides a central question or a main concept that the map should address. For example, "What are the key components of an ecosystem?"

### Step 2: Brainstorm Key Concepts (10-15 minutes)
- Students, either individually or in groups, brainstorm a list of key concepts related to the focus question. For the ecosystem example, this might include terms like *producers*, *consumers*, *decomposers*, *sunlight*, *soil*, *water*, etc.

### Step 3: Rank and Cluster Concepts (10 minutes)
- Students organize their list of concepts, placing the most general, inclusive concepts at the top and more specific concepts below them. They can also group related concepts together.

### Step 4: Construct the Map (15-20 minutes)
- Students start building the map, beginning with the main concept at the top or center.
- They add other concepts as nodes and draw links between related concepts.
- Crucially, they label each link with a connecting phrase (e.g., "is composed of," "leads to," "is an example of") to clarify the relationship.

### Step 5: Review and Refine (10 minutes)
- Students review their maps, looking for new connections and opportunities to refine their structure.
- They can share their maps with other groups for feedback, leading to a richer, more comprehensive understanding.

## Benefits in STEM Courses

- **Promotes Meaningful Learning:** By focusing on relationships, concept maps encourage students to move beyond rote memorization.
- **Makes Thinking Visible:** Concept maps provide a clear visual representation of a student's understanding (and misconceptions).
- **Fosters Systems Thinking:** This is especially valuable in STEM, where understanding complex systems is often a key learning goal.
- **Serves as an Assessment Tool:** Instructors can use concept maps to gauge student understanding before, during, or after a unit.

## Example STEM Concept Mapping Activities

- **Biology:** Create a concept map showing the process of protein synthesis, from DNA to a functional protein.
- **Chemistry:** Map the relationships between different types of chemical bonds (ionic, covalent, metallic) and the properties of substances.
- **Physics:** Develop a concept map to illustrate Newton's laws of motion and their applications.
- **Computer Science:** Create a map that shows the structure of a specific data structure, like a binary search tree, and the operations that can be performed on it.
