# Web-Based Physics Simulations

Interactive simulations let students explore physical principles in a dynamic way without specialized lab equipment. Many instructors use the open-source [PhET](https://phet.colorado.edu/) collection from the University of Colorado Boulder. Research shows that PhET activities improve conceptual understanding and student engagement (**Perkins et al., 2006; Adams et al., 2008**).

## Why Simulations Are Valuable

- **Safe experimentation:** Students can manipulate variables like mass or friction without risk.
- **Immediate feedback:** Visual results help them connect equations with motion.
- **Accessibility:** Simulations run in a browser, so learners can explore at home or in class.

## Example: Projectile Motion Simulator

The following custom React component allows students to adjust launch angle and speed to see how a projectile travels under gravity. By predicting the trajectory and then testing it, learners confront their preconceptions about parabolic motion and the relationship between horizontal and vertical components of velocity.

Students can experiment with different angles and speeds to observe how both affect range and maximum height. Encouraging them to sketch the expected path before adjusting the sliders mirrors the predict–observe–explain cycle common in active learning. Studies of simulation use in physics courses report gains in problem‑solving ability when students manipulate variables themselves (**Finkelstein et al., 2005**).
