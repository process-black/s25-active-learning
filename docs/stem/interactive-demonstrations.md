# Interactive Demonstrations

A teaching method where the instructor performs a physical or virtual demonstration but pauses at key moments to ask students for predictions. This transforms a passive viewing experience into an active, inquiry-based learning activity.

## Overview

The Interactive Lecture Demonstration (ILD) technique, developed by physicists David Sokoloff and Ronald Thornton, is a powerful way to confront and resolve common student misconceptions. By asking students to predict the outcome of a demonstration before they see it, the instructor encourages them to engage with the underlying concepts and commit to a particular line of reasoning.

## The Interactive Demonstration Cycle

### Step 1: Introduce the Demonstration (2-3 minutes)
- The instructor describes the demonstration they are about to perform and the equipment involved.
- They explain the initial setup and what they will do.

### Step 2: Predict the Outcome (5-7 minutes)
- The instructor poses a clear, multiple-choice question asking students to predict the outcome of the demonstration.
- Students first think about their prediction individually.
- Then, they discuss their predictions in small groups, explaining their reasoning to their peers.
- Finally, they vote on the outcome, often using a classroom response system (clickers).

### Step 3: Perform the Demonstration (2-3 minutes)
- The instructor carries out the demonstration exactly as described.
- The result is often displayed clearly, for example, with a graph from a sensor.

### Step 4: Discuss the Results (5-10 minutes)
- The instructor leads a discussion about the observed outcome.
- Key questions to ask:
  - Was the outcome what you predicted?
  - Can we explain why this happened?
  - How does this result relate to the concepts we've been studying?
- This is a crucial step for addressing misconceptions, as students are often very engaged after seeing a surprising result.

## Benefits in STEM Courses

- **Directly Confronts Misconceptions:** The predict-observe-explain cycle is highly effective at helping students recognize and correct their preconceived notions.
- **Increases Engagement:** The element of prediction turns a simple demonstration into an exciting event.
- **Improves Conceptual Understanding:** Students are more likely to remember the concept when they have actively engaged with it in this way.
- **Connects Abstract Concepts to a Physical Reality:** Demonstrations make abstract scientific principles tangible and observable.

## Example STEM Interactive Demonstrations

- **Physics:** Before dropping a heavy and a light ball simultaneously, ask students to predict which will hit the ground first. After they see the result, discuss air resistance and Galileo's principle of equivalence.
- **Chemistry:** Before mixing two clear liquids, ask students to predict if a precipitate will form. After the reaction, discuss solubility rules.
- **Biology:** Show a video of a cell in a hypotonic solution. Pause the video and ask students to predict whether the cell will shrink, swell, or stay the same. Then, play the rest of the video and discuss osmosis.
- **Engineering:** Before applying a load to a model bridge, ask students to predict which part of the structure will fail first. After testing the bridge to failure, discuss stress, strain, and structural design principles.
