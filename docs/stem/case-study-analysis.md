# Case Study Analysis

A teaching method that uses real-life or hypothetical scenarios (cases) to help students apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations. Students analyze the case, identify key issues, and propose solutions or recommendations.

## Overview

Case studies are stories with an educational message. In STEM, they provide a narrative context for complex technical information, making it more relatable and memorable. By analyzing a case, students bridge the gap between theory and practice, developing analytical and decision-making skills.

## The Case Study Analysis Process

### Step 1: Introduce the Case (5-10 minutes)
- The instructor provides the case study to the students. A good case study:
  - Tells a compelling story.
  - Is based on a real-world problem or situation.
  - Contains sufficient detail for analysis but may also include ambiguity.
  - Is relevant to the learning objectives of the course.

### Step 2: Individual or Group Analysis (20-30 minutes)
- Students read and analyze the case, either individually or in small groups. Key tasks include:
  - **Identifying the central problem:** What is the main issue or challenge in the case?
  - **Analyzing the data:** What are the relevant facts, figures, and constraints?
  - **Identifying stakeholders:** Who are the key players, and what are their perspectives and motivations?

### Step 3: Generate and Evaluate Solutions (15-20 minutes)
- Students brainstorm potential solutions or courses of action.
- For each potential solution, they should evaluate the pros and cons, considering the technical, ethical, and practical implications.

### Step 4: Propose and Justify a Recommendation (10-15 minutes)
- Students decide on the best course of action and prepare to justify their recommendation.
- The justification should be supported by evidence from the case and principles from the course.

### Step 5: Class Discussion (15-20 minutes)
- The instructor facilitates a class-wide discussion.
- Different groups can share their analyses and recommendations.
- The instructor can guide the discussion to highlight key learning points and connect the case to broader theoretical concepts.

## Benefits in STEM Courses

- **Improves Problem-Solving Skills:** Students learn to dissect complex problems and develop evidence-based solutions.
- **Develops Analytical Thinking:** Case studies require students to sift through information, identify patterns, and draw logical conclusions.
- **Enhances Ethical Reasoning:** Many STEM case studies involve ethical dilemmas, prompting students to consider the societal impact of their decisions.
- **Provides Context for Learning:** Cases show students why the technical material they are learning matters in the real world.

## Example STEM Case Studies

- **Bioethics:** Analyzing the case of the HeLa cell line to discuss issues of patient consent and the commercialization of biological materials.
- **Engineering:** Studying the Challenger space shuttle disaster to learn about engineering ethics, safety culture, and the importance of clear communication.
- **Data Science:** Analyzing a dataset from a company to identify business insights and making recommendations based on the findings, while also considering data privacy issues.
- **Public Health:** Examining the public health response to a specific disease outbreak (like Ebola or COVID-19) to understand epidemiology and public policy.
