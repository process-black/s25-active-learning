# Problem-Based Learning (PBL)

A student-centered pedagogy in which students learn about a subject through the experience of solving an open-ended problem found in trigger material. The PBL process does not focus on problem solving with a defined solution, but it allows for the development of other desirable skills and attributes.

## Overview

In PBL, students are presented with a complex, real-world problem and work in small collaborative groups to find a solution. The instructor acts as a facilitator rather than a traditional lecturer, guiding the students' inquiry and learning process. This approach helps students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and self-directed learning skills.

## The PBL Process

### Step 1: Present the Problem (5-10 minutes)
- The instructor introduces a complex, ill-structured problem. The problem should:
  - Be authentic and relevant to the students' field of study.
  - Not have a single, straightforward solution.
  - Require students to seek out new knowledge to solve it.

### Step 2: Identify Knowns and Unknowns (10-15 minutes)
- In their small groups, students analyze the problem and create two lists:
  - **What we know:** Information that is already given in the problem statement.
  - **What we need to know:** Questions that need to be answered and knowledge that needs to be acquired to solve the problem.

### Step 3: Define the Problem Statement (10 minutes)
- Based on their analysis, each group formulates a precise problem statement that will guide their research and investigation.

### Step 4: Research and Information Gathering (Can be in or out of class)
- Students divide up the research tasks based on the "what we need to know" list.
- They independently gather information from various sources (textbooks, articles, databases, etc.).

### Step 5: Synthesize and Apply (In-class session)
- Students reconvene in their groups to share their findings.
- They synthesize the new information and apply it to the problem.
- This often involves re-evaluating their initial assumptions and refining their understanding.

### Step 6: Present and Justify the Solution (15-20 minutes)
- Each group develops a solution or a set of recommendations.
- They prepare a presentation or a report to share their solution with the class, justifying their reasoning and the evidence they used.

## Benefits in STEM Courses

- **Develops Critical Thinking:** Students learn to analyze complex problems and think critically about potential solutions.
- **Fosters Self-Directed Learning:** Students take responsibility for their own learning, a crucial skill for lifelong learning in STEM fields.
- **Enhances Collaboration:** PBL is inherently collaborative, improving students' teamwork and communication skills.
- **Connects Theory to Practice:** By working on real-world problems, students see the practical application of theoretical concepts.

## Example STEM PBL Scenarios

- **Medicine:** A group of medical students is given a patient's symptoms and must work together to diagnose the illness and propose a treatment plan.
- **Environmental Science:** Students are tasked with developing a sustainable water management plan for a drought-stricken community.
- **Software Engineering:** A team of students must design and prototype a mobile app to solve a specific societal need, like reducing food waste.
- **Civil Engineering:** Students are given the geological data for a specific location and must design a bridge that is safe, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly.
