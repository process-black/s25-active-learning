# Jigsaw Activities

A cooperative learning strategy where each student in a group becomes an "expert" on a specific subtopic and then teaches it to their peers. This technique promotes both individual accountability and teamwork.

## Overview

The Jigsaw technique is a powerful way to break down complex topics into manageable pieces. Students first work in "expert groups" to master a specific concept and then return to their original "jigsaw groups" to share their knowledge. This process encourages deep learning, peer teaching, and active engagement.

## The Jigsaw Procedure

### Step 1: Form Jigsaw Groups (5 minutes)
- Divide students into small, diverse groups of 4-5 people. These are the "jigsaw groups."
- Assign a specific subtopic or reading to each member of the group. For example, in a biology class studying cellular respiration, each member could be assigned one of the following:
  1.  Glycolysis
  2.  Pyruvate Oxidation
  3.  The Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle)
  4.  Oxidative Phosphorylation

### Step 2: Form Expert Groups (15-20 minutes)
- Students from different jigsaw groups who were assigned the same subtopic now meet in "expert groups."
- In these groups, they:
  - Discuss the main points of their assigned material.
  - Clarify any confusing concepts.
  - Identify the most important information to share with their jigsaw group.
  - Prepare a brief lesson or summary.

### Step 3: Return to Jigsaw Groups (15-20 minutes)
- Students return to their original jigsaw groups.
- Each "expert" takes a turn teaching their subtopic to the rest of the group.
- Other members can ask clarifying questions.
- The goal is for every member of the jigsaw group to understand all the subtopics by the end of the session.

### Step 4: Group Application or Assessment (10-15 minutes)
- The instructor provides a task or a set of problems that requires the group to synthesize all the subtopics.
- This could be a group quiz, a problem-solving activity, or a concept map that connects all the pieces.
- This step reinforces the learning and ensures that the peer teaching was effective.

## Benefits in STEM Courses

- **Encourages Deep Understanding:** To teach a concept, students must understand it thoroughly.
- **Promotes Collaboration:** Students learn to work together and rely on each other's expertise.
- **Builds Communication Skills:** Students practice explaining complex technical concepts to their peers.
- **Efficient Content Coverage:** Allows a class to cover a large amount of material in a relatively short time.

## Example STEM Jigsaw Activities

- **Mathematics:** Different groups become experts on different methods for solving a type of problem (e.g., different integration techniques).
- **Engineering:** Each group member researches a different sustainable energy source (solar, wind, geothermal, hydro) and then they come together to design a comprehensive energy plan for a city.
- **Chemistry:** In a lesson on periodic trends, each expert group focuses on a single trend (atomic radius, ionization energy, electronegativity) and then teaches it to their jigsaw group.
- **Computer Science:** When learning about sorting algorithms, each expert group masters one algorithm (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort) and then explains its mechanics and efficiency to their home group.
