# Gallery Walk Lab Analysis

An interactive method for sharing, analyzing, and discussing experimental results that transforms post-lab discussion from passive presentation to active peer learning.

## Overview

Gallery Walk Lab Analysis allows students to examine multiple experimental setups, data sets, and conclusions simultaneously. This technique promotes peer learning, critical analysis skills, and collaborative interpretation of scientific data while making efficient use of class time.

## The Gallery Walk Process

### Step 1: Preparation Phase (5-10 minutes)
Students prepare their lab results for display:
- **Data Visualization**: Create clear graphs, charts, or data tables
- **Key Findings**: Summarize 2-3 main results or observations
- **Questions/Challenges**: Note any unexpected results or difficulties
- **Materials**: Post on large paper, whiteboards, or poster boards

### Step 2: Gallery Setup (5 minutes)
Arrange displays around the room:
- **Spacing**: Allow room for 3-4 students to gather around each display
- **Organization**: Group by experimental variables or research questions
- **Materials**: Provide sticky notes, markers, or feedback forms
- **Instructions**: Post clear guidelines for viewers

### Step 3: Active Viewing (15-20 minutes)
Students rotate through displays:
- **Individual Analysis**: Spend 2-3 minutes examining each display
- **Peer Discussion**: Talk with others viewing the same results
- **Documentation**: Record observations, questions, or insights
- **Feedback**: Leave constructive comments or questions for presenters

### Step 4: Facilitated Discussion (10-15 minutes)
Whole-class analysis and synthesis:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common trends across experiments
- **Anomaly Discussion**: Explore unexpected or outlier results
- **Method Evaluation**: Compare different experimental approaches
- **Knowledge Building**: Connect findings to theoretical concepts

## Implementation Strategies

### Pre-Lab Preparation
**Set Clear Expectations:**
- Explain how results will be shared and discussed
- Provide templates for data presentation
- Establish criteria for effective displays
- Plan for different group completion times

**Design for Sharing:**
- Consider how results will be compared across groups
- Plan experiments with enough variability for interesting discussion
- Ensure all groups can contribute meaningfully
- Prepare backup activities for early finishers

### During the Gallery Walk

**Facilitate Active Viewing:**
- Provide specific questions or prompts for viewers
- Encourage discussion between students viewing the same display
- Monitor conversations and provide guidance as needed
- Keep groups moving to ensure all displays are visited

**Promote Critical Analysis:**
- Ask probing questions about unexpected results
- Encourage comparison between different approaches
- Guide students to identify patterns and trends
- Help students connect observations to theoretical concepts

### Post-Walk Discussion

**Synthesize Learning:**
- Identify common themes across all experiments
- Address misconceptions revealed through student discussions
- Connect experimental results to broader course concepts
- Highlight excellent examples of analysis or presentation

## Assessment Opportunities

### Peer Assessment
Students evaluate each other's work:
- **Clarity of Presentation**: How well are results communicated?
- **Quality of Analysis**: Are conclusions supported by data?
- **Experimental Technique**: Was the procedure followed effectively?
- **Critical Thinking**: Are alternative explanations considered?

### Self-Reflection
Prompt students to consider:
- What did you learn from seeing other groups' results?
- How did your results compare to theoretical predictions?
- What would you do differently if you repeated the experiment?
- Which group's approach or analysis impressed you most, and why?

### Instructor Observation
Assess during the gallery walk:
- **Engagement Level**: Are students actively discussing results?
- **Quality of Questions**: Do students ask thoughtful questions?
- **Conceptual Understanding**: Do discussions reveal mastery of concepts?
- **Collaborative Skills**: How well do students work together during viewing?

## Digital Adaptations

### Online Gallery Walks
For remote or hybrid learning:
- **Shared Documents**: Google Slides or Padlet for posting results
- **Breakout Rooms**: Small groups rotate through different "rooms"
- **Discussion Boards**: Asynchronous comments and questions
- **Video Presentations**: Short recordings explaining results

### Technology Integration
Enhance in-person gallery walks:
- **QR Codes**: Link to additional data or video explanations
- **Digital Polling**: Real-time questions about displays
- **Collaborative Documents**: Shared note-taking during viewing
- **Photo Documentation**: Capture displays for later reference

## Variations and Extensions

### Jigsaw Gallery Walk
