# Team-Based Learning

A structured form of small-group learning that emphasizes student preparation out of class and application of knowledge in class. Students work in permanent teams to complete readiness assurance tests and team-based application exercises.

## Overview

Team-Based Learning (TBL) divides a course into modules that follow a consistent sequence: preparation, readiness assurance, and application. This format encourages accountability, collaboration, and the practical use of course concepts.

## The TBL Sequence

### 1. Pre-Class Preparation
- Students complete assigned readings or multimedia lessons before class.
- They may take a short individual quiz to ensure accountability.

### 2. Readiness Assurance Process
- **Individual Readiness Assurance Test (iRAT):** Students take a short quiz individually to assess their understanding of the preparatory material.
- **Team Readiness Assurance Test (tRAT):** Students then take the same quiz again in their permanent teams, discussing each question to reach consensus.
- **Instructor Clarification:** The instructor reviews quiz results and addresses any widespread misunderstandings.

### 3. Application Activities
- Teams work on challenging, real-world problems that require them to apply the concepts from the preparation phase.
- These problems are designed to have significant consequences, encouraging lively discussion and decision making.
- Teams often report their solutions simultaneously to foster comparison and debate.

## Benefits in STEM Courses

- **Deeper Understanding:** The combination of individual accountability and team discussion promotes comprehension and retention.
- **Collaborative Skills:** Students learn to communicate effectively and rely on each other's expertise.
- **Immediate Feedback:** The readiness assurance tests provide quick insight into misconceptions.
- **Scalable Approach:** TBL works well in large lectures because the teams are self-managing once the structure is established.

## Example STEM Applications

- **Engineering:** Teams design and evaluate alternative solutions to a design challenge.
- **Biology:** Students interpret experimental data and decide on the next steps in a research scenario.
- **Computer Science:** Teams critique sample code and optimize algorithms for efficiency.

TBL transforms lectures into interactive sessions where teams actively engage with complex problems, mirroring collaboration in professional STEM environments.
