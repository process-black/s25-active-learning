# Project-Based Learning

An instructional approach where students gain knowledge and skills by working for an extended period to investigate and respond to a complex question, problem, or challenge. The culmination is a concrete product or presentation that demonstrates their learning.

## Overview

Project-Based Learning (PBL) emphasizes the creation of a meaningful project that integrates course content with real-world relevance. Students collaborate to research, design, and build solutions, often across multiple weeks of class time.

## Key Elements of PBL

### Authentic Problem or Question
- The project is framed around an open-ended problem that mirrors professional practice.
- It should require students to apply multiple concepts from the course.

### Sustained Inquiry
- Students engage in a cycle of questioning, researching, and refining their ideas.
- The instructor acts as a facilitator, providing guidance rather than direct answers.

### Student Voice and Choice
- Teams make decisions about how to approach the project and what final product to create.
- This autonomy increases investment and promotes creativity.

### Public Product
- Students present their work to an audience beyond the classroom, such as industry mentors or campus peers.
- Public presentation encourages high-quality work and reflection.

## Benefits in STEM Courses

- **Integration of Skills:** Students apply technical knowledge, communication, and teamwork simultaneously.
- **Motivation Through Relevance:** Projects tied to real-world needs make learning meaningful and memorable.
- **Preparation for Professional Work:** PBL mirrors the collaborative and iterative nature of STEM careers.
- **Opportunity for Interdisciplinary Learning:** Projects often draw on multiple fields, encouraging broader thinking.

## Example STEM Projects

- **Environmental Science:** Design a remediation plan for a local waterway affected by pollution.
- **Mechanical Engineering:** Build a prototype device that addresses a community need, such as an assistive tool.
- **Computer Science:** Create a data visualization dashboard to solve a practical problem posed by a research lab.

Project-Based Learning transforms a course into a dynamic environment where students drive their own learning through sustained, authentic challenges.
