# Inquiry-Based Labs

A lab format where students design experiments, collect data, and draw conclusions with minimal step-by-step instructions. Inquiry-based labs foster curiosity and mirror the investigative nature of real scientific research.

## Overview

Instead of following a predetermined procedure, students are presented with a question or problem and must determine how to investigate it. This approach develops critical thinking and emphasizes the process of scientific discovery.

## Implementing Inquiry-Based Labs

### 1. Present the Guiding Question
- Pose a question that aligns with the course objectives and allows for multiple approaches.
- Encourage students to brainstorm possible methods for investigation.

### 2. Plan the Investigation
- Students design their own procedures, identifying needed materials and variables to control.
- The instructor reviews plans for feasibility and safety but avoids prescribing exact steps.

### 3. Conduct the Experiment
- Students carry out their proposed investigations, adjusting methods as necessary.
- They record observations and data carefully, noting any unexpected issues.

### 4. Analyze and Interpret Results
- Teams analyze their data, create graphs, and consider how their findings answer the guiding question.
- They discuss sources of error and potential improvements for future trials.

### 5. Share Findings
- Students present their conclusions through brief reports or presentations.
- The class compares different experimental approaches and outcomes, highlighting the scientific method in action.

## Benefits in STEM Courses

- **Authentic Research Skills:** Students practice designing experiments and analyzing real data.
- **Deeper Engagement:** Ownership of the procedure increases motivation and curiosity.
- **Resilience and Adaptability:** Students learn to troubleshoot and refine their methods when results are unexpected.
- **Transferable Skills:** The focus on inquiry prepares students for research experiences beyond the classroom.

Inquiry-based labs turn standard experiments into opportunities for discovery, helping students understand how scientific knowledge is built through investigation.
