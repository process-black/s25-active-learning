# Document Analysis Workshops

Interactive sessions that engage students in collaborative examination and interpretation of primary sources, developing critical analysis skills through structured investigation of historical documents, literary texts, and cultural artifacts.

## Overview

Document Analysis Workshops transform passive reading into active investigation, where students work together to decode, contextualize, and interpret primary sources. This approach develops essential humanities skills including source criticism, historical thinking, and evidence-based argumentation while making abstract concepts tangible through direct engagement with authentic materials.

## Core Learning Objectives

- **Evaluate Source Credibility**: Assess authorship, purpose, audience, and bias
- **Contextualize Documents**: Understand historical, cultural, and social contexts
- **Identify Perspectives**: Recognize multiple viewpoints and missing voices
- **Analyze Language**: Examine word choice, tone, and rhetorical strategies

### Collaborative Inquiry Skills
Students develop:
- **Question Formation**: Generate meaningful research questions from sources
- **Evidence Synthesis**: Combine multiple sources to build arguments
- **Perspective Sharing**: Learn from diverse interpretations and approaches
- **Consensus Building**: Negotiate understanding through respectful dialogue

### Research Methodology
Students practice:
- **Source Comparison**: Analyze similarities and differences across documents
